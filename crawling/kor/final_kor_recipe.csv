Rub ¨ù cup of kosher salt all over the chicken and giblets, then rinse in cold water until they are very clean. Drain and put them into a large heavy pot. Cut 1 daepa or 8 green onions into 4 inch long pieces and add them to the pot along with the ginger. Add 14 cups of water and cover. Cook for 1 hour over medium high heat until the chicken is tender. If its still tough, add some more water and cook a little longer until you can pull the chicken apart easily. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and let it cool down until you can handle it with your hands. Separate the meat from the bones with your hands. Tear the meat into bite sized strips. Add 1 tablespoon fish sauce and 1 teaspoon kosher salt to the meat and mix it well by hand. Set aside. Put a cotton cloth, a cheese cloth folded over a few times, or a sheet of cooking paper made for filtering soup the photo below on a wire mesh strainer over a large bowl.I found these paper filters in the kitchenware section of a Korean grocery store. Theyre very useful for filtering broth and I use them to line my steamer basket, too. Unfortunately the package is all in Korean except one line on top Cooking Papers, Pour the broth through the papercloth filter so all the fat, cooked green onion, and ginger are strained out. You should have about 11 cups of clear and flavorful broth in the bowl under the strainer. Discard all the stuff in the cotton cloth. Wash the pot nicely and put the chicken broth back in it. Heat the vegetable oil in a small pan for about 1 minute over medium heat. Add the onion and fry for about 7 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until the onion turns a little crispy. Break up the dried red peppers and add them to the pan with the seeds. Gently stir the mixture with a wooden spoon for a few more minutes until the red peppers turn light brown or orange. Remove from the heat and strain the mixture over a bowl. Press it down with the wooden spoon to squeeze out every drop of oil. You will get about 3 tablespoons of orange-colored, smoky, flavorful oil. Add hot pepper flakes, toasted sesame oil, ground black pepper, and 1 tablespoon kosher salt to the hot oil. Mix it well and set aside. Put the mung bean sprouts into a large bowl. Chop the softened gosari 1 or 2 times and add them to the bowl, too. Cut the other 2 daepa in half lengthwise, and then cut them across into 4 inch long pieces. Add them to the bowl. If you use regular green onions, cut them into 4 inch long pieces. Add the seasoning mixture and the garlic. Gently mix everything with your hand until all the vegetables are coated with the seasoning mixture . Bring the chicken broth to a boil. Add the seasoned vegetables and cook for 20 minutes over medium high heat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook another 5 to 10 minutes until it boils vigorously. Remove from the heat and serve right away with rice and kimchi, or a few more side dishes.

Drizzle the sesame oil and the cooking oil over the flour, circularly. Add the cinnamon powder. Using a rice scoop or a wooden spoon, mix the oil in with the flour until well blended. To get rid of the larger lumps, gently rub the flour between your both hands, a little bit at at time, breaking up the lumps. Keep doing it until the big lumps are gone and the flour is well blended with the oil. Sift the seasoned flour into a bowl or an airtight container. Cover and set aside. You can refrigerate it for later if youre not going to make the cookies right away. Combine the ginger juice, salt, honey, soju, and black pepper in a small bowl. Mix well with a wooden spoon until the honey is dissolved. Set aside. Combine the ginger juice, rice syrup, water, and sugar in a large sauce pan. The cookies will eventually be added to this pan, so choose one large and wide enough to fit all of them. Cook uncovered over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes until small bubbles pop up and cover about ¨ö of the surface. The consistency of the syrup should still be runny. Remove from the heat. Add the flavored honey and soju mixture to the oiled flour a little by little as you mix it in. Use a wooden spoon or a rice scoop in a chopping motion to mix it up, as opposed to kneading it in like bread or noodles. Eventually it will look like crumbled dough but it will form roughly into one lump. Put the dough on your large cutting board or workspace. Press and gently grab the dough with both hands to shape it up a bit, without kneading. Use your roller to shape and beat it into a rectangle about 6 x 12 inches and ¨÷ inch thick. Fold or cut it in half and then roll it out into a rectangle again. Do this a couple of times to give the cookies some nice layers. Cut the dough into about 1 inch squares or use a cookie cutter to create some fun shapes. I used a 2¨ö inch flower shaped pie plunger and a heart shaped cookie cutter, but some people just cut it into squares.  You should get about 20 to 24 cookies. Poke some holes in the middle of the cookies with a chopstick so the dough cooks evenly in the oil. Heat 2 inches of cooking oil in a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes. I used 4 cups grape seed oil in my 12 inch skillet. When the temperature reaches around 250F 120C, add the raw cookies one by one. They will sink to the bottom of the skillet at first but soon small bubbles will come up and about 5 minutes later they will float to the surface one by one. Turn them over with long wooden cooking chopsticks or tongs. Keep moving and turning them in the oil so they cook evenly, until both sides turn light brown, which should take about 5 minutes. Remove the cookies and put them into a stainless-steel strainer over a bowl. Drain the excess oil and set aside. Increase the heat to medium-high for a couple of minutes until the oil heats up to about 330F 165C. Fry the cookies and turn them over for 2 to 3 minutes until both sides of each cookie turn a nice brown. Remove them from the oil and put them into a stainless-steel strainer over a bowl. Drain the excess oil for a minute, then add all the cookies to the coating syrup in the pan. Mix them with a wooden spoon and let them sit in the pan at least 3 to 4 hours up to overnight, turning them over a couple of times now and then to soak them evenly. Use a slotted spoon to remove the cookies from the pan and place some on a plate. Garnish with pumpkin seeds andor pine nuts, andor threads of ginger. Serve with your favorite tea of coffee. I usually eat them with green tea. You can freeze these cookies for months."

Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 12 minutes, or until the rice is bubbling and beginning to boil over. Open and stir the rice with a wooden spoon to make sure that none is sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for another 10 minutes, until the rice is fluffy and fully cooked. Remove from the heat. Fluff the cooked rice with the wooden spoon. It may be a little crunchy on the bottom, but thats fine. Add 8 cups of water and stir well with the wooden spoon. The temperature should be about 140 F.

And the rice will be the consistency of wet paper because all the starch is drawn out. Stir the mixture well. Line a large strainer with a large piece of hemp cloth or double folded cheese cloth. Place the strainer over a large bowl. Pour the rice mixture into the cloth-lined strainer. Let it drain for about 10 minutes, until some liquid has seeped into the bowl and the cloth is cool enough to handle. You can stir the mixture with the wooden spoon.

Stir from time to time and keep boiling for 10 to 20 minutes, until medium sized bubbles about ¨ö inch appear. Insert a thermometer and the temperature should be 200-220 F. Remove from the heat. The syrup should be stickier, sweeter, and darker. It should drizzle off a spoon in a thick, steady stream, like maple syrup.

This is time-consuming, but you dont want to lose any of the precious liquid, so squeeze out as much as you can. You will have 5 to 6 cups. Discard the solids. Wash the inner pot of the rice cooker and put it back in the rice cooker. Add the strained liquid. Set the rice cooker to cooking with the lid open, and cook for 30 minutes, or until large bubbles appear. Stir with a wooden spoon. Turn off the rice cooker. You will have about 1¨ö cups rice syrup.

Combine the soy sauce, brown or white sugar, ground black pepper, and garlic in a bowl and mix well with a spoon until the sugar is dissolved. Cover and set aside. Drain the wood ear mushrooms and put them on your cutting board. Cut off the tough stems and discard them. Cut the caps into bite-size pieces and put them into the pot. Add the king oyster mushrooms, carrot, and onion to the pot. Add ¨ù cup vegetable oil and ¨ù cup water to the pot. Mix well everything in the pot with both hands so that all the vegetables and mushrooms are nicely coated with oil. This will not only prevent the ingredients from turning brown from the seasoning sauce, but will also keep them from burning when you cook. Spread the spinach over top in an even layer. Drain the noodles and cut them into 5- to 6-inch lengths with scissors. Place them on top of the spinach in the pot. Drizzle the seasoning sauce on top of the noodles. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium-high heat. Open the lid and stir and gently toss all the ingredients with a wooden spoon and tongs for 1 to 2 minutes, until all the liquid has evaporated and the noodles are nicely cooked and shiny. Add the cooked meat if using, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds. Gently toss the mixture so that all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Transfer to a large platter. Garnish with the egg paper strips if using and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, and serve. Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. To reheat, stir-fry in a skillet with a few tablespoons water or vegetable oil."

Combine the chestnuts, ¨ù cup water, and 1 tablespoon of white sugar in a pan. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. The chestnuts will turn yellowish and shiny. Remove from the heat and set aside. Put the beans in a bowl. Using your fingers, remove the skins of a handful of beans, leaving them bright green. Just do a handful of them, for color. Add jujubes, pine nuts, the chestnuts and about 3 tablespoons syrup. Mix it well and set aside. Place the glutinous rice flour in a large bowl and sprinkle the salt over top. Add the water little by little to the flour, mixing up the rice flour and breaking up as many lumps as you can with a wooden spoon or rice scoop as you go. To totally remove the lumps, put them between your palms, rub them together, and break the lumps apart until all the big lumps are gone and the rice flour is evenly wet. It will take about 2 minutes. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.tip You can make this moist rice flour in advance. Put it in a plastic bag or an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. In a large steamer, bring 2 inches of water to a boil. Take out the steamer basket. Wet the cotton cloth and spread it on the bottom. Add about half of the super-nutritious ingredients and spread them evenly on the cotton cloth. The jujubes should be arranged so the bright red part is facing down. Add the rice flour. Gently flatten it out evenly by hand. Add the rest of the super-nutritious ingredients and flatten them out evenly. The bright red parts of the jujubes should be facingup. Wrap the ends of the cloth around the top of the rice cake. Put the steamer basket with the rice cake inside the steamer. Steam over medium high heat for 40 minutes and another 5 minutes over low heat. Remove from the heat. Open and let it cool for about 10 minutes until you can handle the rice cake with your hands. Put some syrup on a large cutting board or a tray. I used my 13 by 9 inch tray, which will help keep the rice cake together as you shape it. Grab the ends of the cloth of the rice cake and carefully lift it out of the steamer basket, onto the syrup on the cutting board or on the tray. Gently pull out the cloth and spread and shape the rice cake into a rectangle about 13 inches by 9 inches. The rice cake is very hot, so youll need to wear rubber gloves and dip your fingers in cold water as you shape the rice cake. Drizzle the rest of the syrup over top. Let cool for about 30 minutes and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Serve right away or wrap each piece in plastic and freeze. To serve frozen rice cake, first leave it the kitchen counter at room temperature for about 20 to 30 minutes so that it thaws out.

Put them on the baking pan and cover them loosely with plastic wrap to keep them from drying out while you work. Take out a dough ball and put it on the cutting board. Press it down with your hands and shape it into rectangle that can cover a sausage. Add a sausage to the center and wrap the dough around it. Pinch the ends together to seal it, smoothing it out so the seal is totally even with the rest of the dough and not lumpy at all. Roll the sausage so the dough is smooth and totally covers it. Put it back on the baking pan. Repeat this with rest of the dough balls and sausages, leaving a gap of a few inches between each roll on the pan. Take one roll and cut into the sausage crosswise at about a 45 angle and about ¨ö inch down from the end. Make sure you dont cut the dough through, it should still be attached to the rest of the roll. Gently push the cut piece up and lay it down flat on the pan. Cut the sausage again about a ¨ö inch further down from the first cut. Gently lift the cut section up, push it to the left, and lay it on the pan. Cut the sausage again another ¨ö inch down and gently move the cut section to the right. Keep cutting and alternating, shaping the bread into something that looks like a leaf with a flat strip of dough down the middle for toppings. I usually make 10 or 11 cuts. Repeat with the rest of the sausages. Combine corn, green bell pepper, and onion in a small bowl. Add the mayonnaise and mix it well with a spoon. Divide the toppings into 5 portions and put one portion on each sausage bread. Divide the cheese into 5 portions and spread it on top of each sausage bread, down the middle.

Add water that is three times as deep as the beans, cover, and cook over medium-high heat for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to medium and continue cooking until the beans are soft enough mash easily, 4¨ö to 5 hours, checking to make sure the beans remain covered with water, and replenishing as necessary. Drain the beans in a colander. Mash the drained beans to a paste in batches with a large mortar and pestle or in a food processor. Dont finely grind them, leave some beans half-crushed. Divide the mashed beans into 3 portions. Knead each portion with both hands and shape into a firm rectangular block measuring 6 x 3 x 4 inches. Traditionally Koreans dry meju on the heatedondolfloors of their homes, and if you live in Korea or have that kind of heating in your house, you can do that too. But in my NYC apartment I simulate ondol by putting an electric blanket on the floor. Line the blanket with a clean cotton cloth or waxed paper and set the blocks on top, or put them in an open basket. Set the heat to low. Dry the blocks, rotating them occasionally, until they are solid enough to hang, 3 to 4 days. Tie each block up in cotton twine and hang them. You can hang them outside but be sure to keep them covered and out of the rain, and if its too hot out they may rot. Inside, you can hang them from the ceiling with hooks. Wherever they hang, the spot should be cool and well-ventilated and all sides of the blocks should be exposed to air and not touching each other. Let the blocks hang for 6 weeks, until they are well dried out and smell a little pungent when you get your nose close to them. Now its time to ferment the bean blocks. Place a layer of dried rice straw or hay in the bottom of a cardboard box thats just big enough to hold the blocks with a little space between them the straw will insulate the blocks and attract good bacteria like Bacillus subtilis in the air. Dont worry if you cant find straw or hay the blocks will still attract good bacteria. Cover the box and put it on the electric blanket. Set the heat to low and let the bean blocks ferment for 2 weeks. At this point, the well-fermented bean blocks will smell a little earthy and pungent and will be covered with white, brownish-yellow, or sometimes greenish fungi. These fungi change the bean proteins to peptides and amino acids, which will give the bean paste its delicious nutty flavor. Tie the fermented bean blocks up in cotton twine and hang from the ceiling, as before, for 1 month. Wash the blocks in cold water and to remove the fungi. Place the blocks in a shallow basket or on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper and let them dry in the sunlight for 1 day, turning them until every side of each block is dried. Combine the 3¨ö gallons water 56 cups and 5 quarts of the kosher salt 20 cups in a large bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until the salt is thoroughly dissolved. Set out a 4- to 5-gallon earthenware crock. Put 2 pieces of the charcoal on a gas burner turn on the flame, and heat until they are glowing red. If you dont have a gas burner, use the broiler Put the charcoal pieces under the broiler and turn it on remove the charcoal when it is red. Use tongs to transfer the charcoal to the earthenware crock. Drizzle the honey over the burning charcoal. Cover the crock and wait for 5 minutes. Remove the lid. You will see lots of smoke and smell a good caramel aroma. This process sterilizes the inside of the crock and will give the sauce good flavor. Remove the charcoal and wipe the inside of the crock with paper towels. Add the bean blocks and salted water to the crock. Add the remaining piece of charcoal, the jujubes, and dried hot peppers they will float on the surface of the water. The charcoal will attract and absorb any dust. The jujubes add sweetness and the dried red peppers help prevent the blocks from going bad. Evenly sprinkle ¨ù cup salt over the tops of the meju blocks exposed to the air. Cover the crock with flour sacking or cheesecloth and put on the lid. Let the blocks soak in the salty water until well fermented, 2 to 3 months. On clear days remove the lid and let the crock sit in the sunlight. Close it at night and be sure to keep the crock covered with the cloth so bugs and dust cant get in. As time passes, the salty water will turn brown and smell like deeply fermented soy sauce. Discard the charcoal, jujubes, and peppers. Transfer the soaked bean blocks to a large bowl. The blocks may have broken up during the soak, so use a bowl to scoop the soy sauce out of the crock and into a strainer set over another large bowl. Add any pieces of bean block to the bean block bowl. Save the soy sauce for makingKorean soup soy sauce gukganjanglater. Mix the doenjang with both hands, breaking it up into a paste, and transfer it to a 5-quart earthenware crock. Pack it down and sprinkle with the remaining ¨ù cup kosher salt. Cover with the cotton cloth, secure it with a rubber band, and put on the lid. Put the doenjang crock in a sunny spot for its final fermentation. About twice a week on sunny days, remove the lid and let the sunlight shine into the crock through the cotton cloth. When its well fermented, the doenjang will smell sweet and taste salty and earthy, with a deep flavor. This will take 5 to 6 months. If it ever looks a little too dry on top, pour some of the separated soy sauce on top to make it moist again. You dont need to stir it in. Store the doenjang in the crock outside the house or at room temperature. Whenever you take some out, press the rest down with a spoon to keep out the air. Once in a while, take the lid off, cover with a cotton cloth, and let the sun hit it again."

Mix well until everything is well dissolved. Crack an egg into the saucepan and mix well. Add the yeast and stir. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Add 3 cups flour and mix well with a wooden spoon. When everything is well mixed, use your hand to knead the dough for a few minutes, and shape it into a big lump. Cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size, usually about 1 hour to 1¨ö hours. Deflate the gas with your hand and knead the dough for a few minutes until its soft and smooth. Cover with plastic wrap again and let it sit for 30 minutes to 1 hour until it doubles in size again. Uncover the dough and knead it for a few minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of flour on the corner of your cutting board to use for dusting. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces. Take a piece of dough and roll it out on your cutting board so it forms a rope 10 inches long and ¨ö inch in diameter. If its sticky, sprinkle some flour on the area youre working in. When you roll out the dough, move one hand upward and the other downward so that the rope is twisted in between your hands as you roll it. Take the dough off the board, hold it aloft, and bring the ends together. The tension in the dough will twist it as it hangs. You can add as much tension as you like, but I think the best looking kkwabaegi has 3 to 4 twists in it. Place the twisted dough on a floured cutting board or tray. Repeat with the rest of the pieces of dough. Let the doughnuts expand for about 30 minutes. 15 minutes in, gently flip each doughnut over with your hands so the bottoms dont get flat and all sides expand nice and round. Heat up 4 inches of oil in a deep skillet over medium high heat, until the temperature reaches 350 F. Lower the heat to medium heat, then gently set each doughnut into the hot oil by hand. Be careful not to get your hands too close to the oil. Add as many pieces to the oil as your skillet will allow, enough so the doughnuts can sit in the oil without pushing against each other. Cook for about 5 minutes, occasionally gently flipping them over with tongs, until they get crunchy outside and are evenly golden brown. Strain the cooked doughnuts. Put them in the brown paper bag with the sugar cinnamon mixture. Shake a few times until they are evenly coated. This is best done when the doughnuts are still warm. Repeat this with all the doughnuts until they are all cooked and coated. Serve hot. You can freeze any leftovers for up to a month. To rejuvenate them, take them out of the freezer and thaw at room temperature for 5 or 10 minutes before serving."

The key is to always keep the rough side out, so it ends up next to the grill and the shiny side in, so it never touches the grill. Remove from the heat. Cut them into bite size pieces. Serve with rice or as a side dish with beer. Keep the leftovers in a small sandwich bag or an airtight container and serve it over the next few days. If you roast a large quantity, keep the excess in the freezer, and only take it out as you need it."

Remove the gills with a knife or your fingers. Cut off any stringy stuff eyes  antennae from the edge of the shell with scissors. Clean all the crabs this way, and keep track of which shell goes with which body. Brush the crabs in cold running water to clean them thoroughly. But be sure not to wash away thetomalleyaka mustard.

Cut the crab into bite size pieces with a knife or scissors. Crush the hard claw with the back of your knife, which will help you get to the delicious meat without damaging your teeth.

Put some rice mixed with marinade on a sheet of roastedkimseaweed paper, add some sliced cucumber optional and eat. Buy live crabs and freeze them for 2 hours before you start. If you like roe, then be sure to buy female crabs during spawning season when they should have eggs. If youre unsure of the season or the sex of the crab, ask your fishmonger before you buy them. If you dont want to clean crabs, you can ask your fishmonger to do it for you, and then you dont need to freeze them either. I sometimes find some worms inside the gills. The worms arent harmful, but nobody wants to eat worms in their sauce, which is why I remove the gills entirely. Korean people call this dish a rice thief ¹äµµµÏ bap-do-duk because it goes so well with rice that before you know it, all the rice will be gone from your bowl, After eating your ganjang-gejang youll probably have some leftover marinade at the bottom.

Reheat the oil and fry the wings again for another 12 to 15 minutes until they all look golden brown and feel super crunchy through the tongs. If your frying pan or pot is not large enough to fry all the chicken at once, divide it into batches like I do in the video. If you use a larger frying pot to deep fry them all at once, youll have to use more cooking oil. If using the peanuts, place them in a slotted spoon or a small mesh strainer, carefully dip them into the hot oil, and fry for 15 to 30 seconds, just until light golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl. When the chicken is done, reheat the sauce until it bubbles. Add the hot chicken and peanuts if using and mix well with a wooden spoon to coat. Remove from the heat and transfer the coated chicken to a large platter. Sprinkle some sesame seeds over top and serve immediately.
